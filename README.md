# Progressive Webapp Skeleton

<img src="http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/ages-12.svg" />

A Progressive Single-page app boilerplate written with React/Redux in ES20XX, served by Express, built by Webpack, and tested with Mocha.


## Getting Started

Right now, it's pretty rudimentary.

```sh
npm install
npm build:copyStatic
npm build
npm start
```

## Why?

When I want to learn a new "stack", I tend to start by making a boilerplate for it. To do that, I read a bunch of pre-existing boilerplates and grab what makes sense.

The goal of this is to have a reasonable progressive webapp skeleton. This means it needs to have access to service workers, some sensible caching starting points, a framework worth using, etc.

## Testing

`npm test`

## Customizing


## Help
TBH, you're really on your own here. If you want a comprehensive, supported starting point, you might try [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/)
